## Introduction

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It provides a powerful and easy-to-use framework for working with mathematical symbols and expressions. Whether you're performing algebraic manipulations, solving equations, or simplifying complex mathematical formulas, SymPy can help.

## Features

- **Symbolic Variables:** Define and manipulate symbolic variables to create symbolic expressions.

- **Algebraic Manipulations:** Perform algebraic operations such as simplification, expansion, and factorization on expressions.

- **Equation Solving:** Solve equations symbolically, including linear, quadratic, and transcendental equations.

- **Calculus:** Perform differentiation, integration, and limit calculations symbolically.

- **Linear Algebra:** Work with matrices and vectors for symbolic linear algebra operations.

- **Number Theory:** Explore number theory concepts like prime numbers, divisors, and modular arithmetic.

## Installation

To install SymPy, use pip:

```bash
pip install sympy
```

## Getting Started

### Import SymPy

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, diff, integrate
```

### Define Symbolic Variables

```python
x, y = symbols('x y')
```

### Perform Algebraic Manipulations

```python
expr = (x + y)**2
expanded_expr = expr.expand()
```

### Solve Equations

```python
equation = Eq(x**2 - 4, 0)
solutions = solve(equation, x)
```

### Calculus

```python
derivative = diff(x**2, x)
integral = integrate(x**2, x)
```

### Linear Algebra

```python
from sympy import Matrix

A = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = Matrix([x, y])
result = A * B
```
